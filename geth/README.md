## Guide

In this folder, you can find:

1. The five different folders from each blockchain client (privchain1...privchain5).
2. The genesis file used in our blockchain (read the report for parameters explanation).
3. A file containing a common password for all the accounts, used for initializing the geth clients.
4. A JavaScript file preload on each client, which simulates the PoET consensus protocol.
